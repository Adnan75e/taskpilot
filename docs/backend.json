    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure authorization independence, clarity, and scalability, following the principles outlined in the prompt. It leverages path-based ownership for user-specific data and separates concerns by storing different types of data in distinct collections. The design avoids `get()` calls in security rules by denormalizing necessary authorization data, thus enabling atomic operations and enhancing security.  \n\nSpecifically:\n\n*   **/users/{userId}:** Stores user profiles. Access is restricted to the user themselves. Admins could be given access via a global role.\n*   **/users/{userId}/tasks/{taskId}:** Stores tasks assigned to a specific user. This structure ensures that tasks are directly associated with users, simplifying ownership-based security rules.  Authorization independence is achieved because access control depends only on the `userId` in the path.\n\nThis structure supports secure `list` operations (QAPs) by:\n\n*   Segregating user-specific data into subcollections. This allows listing only the tasks belonging to a specific user without needing complex filtering rules.\n*   Avoiding the need to read data from other documents to enforce authorization. Each path inherently defines the accessible data, preventing unauthorized access during `list` operations.\n"
