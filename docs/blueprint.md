# **App Name**: TaskPilot

## Core Features:

- User Role Selection: Allows users to select their role (Admin or Staff) to customize their workspace experience.
- Admin Dashboard: Provides a dashboard for admins to manage teams, tasks, and analytics.
- Staff Task View: Enables staff members to view assigned tasks and track their progress.
- Welcome Screen: Presents a user-friendly welcome screen upon app launch to guide users to their respective roles.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#B39DDB) to evoke a sense of calm and focus. This color aligns with the intention of efficient task management without overwhelming the user.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F3E5F5) - visibly of the same hue as the primary color, but heavily desaturated for a clean background.
- Accent color: Light violet (#9575CD) – analogous to the primary, a different hue with brightness and saturation for contrast.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif. This will be used for both headlines and body text to create a modern, neutral feel.
- The welcome screen includes role selection buttons for clear user direction.
- Use simple, professional icons to represent each role (e.g., a shield for Admin, a person for Staff).
- Incorporate subtle animations for a smooth user experience when transitioning between screens.
